Cornelia

___
from [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Dunova/Nation of Dunova\|Nation of Dunova]], real pretty and blue coded beast woman, presumably has roots in the [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Beast Kingdom/Beast Kingdom\|Beast Kingdom]] but is now a traveling bard. Closest with [[Fagula/Characters/Allies/Party/Edgar (Pemble)\|Edgar (Pemble)]], and has been traveling with the group during the quest [[Fagula/Quests/Liberate The Iron Pond\|Liberate The Iron Pond]].
