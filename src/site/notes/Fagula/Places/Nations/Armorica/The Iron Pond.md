The Iron Pond
--

An [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Armorica/Armorican\|Armorican]] prison in the [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Armorica/Armorican Forest\|Armorican Forest]] made to hold the most heinous of criminals. Was taken over by [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Elonia/The Empire of Elonia\|The Empire of Elonia]], and managed in part by [[Fagula/Characters/Enemies/Novo\|Novo]]. It was repurposed to hold the members of the [[Fagula/Characters/Groups/Red Band\|Red Band]].

Notably, it was guarded by [[Fagula/Characters/Enemies/Percy, Demon of Hell\|Percy, Demon of Hell]], and held [[Fagula/Characters/Allies/Drax\|Drax]], as well as many other red band members who were presumably close with [[Fagula/Characters/Allies/Atticus\|Atticus]].
