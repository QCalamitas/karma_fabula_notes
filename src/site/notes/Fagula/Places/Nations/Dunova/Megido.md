A once great magical city of [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Dunova/Nation of Dunova\|Nation of Dunova]] guarded by Deshe-valt, it was a city of expansion and magical innovation before a mishap turned it into a crater. It was studied in great detail by [[Fagula/Characters/Allies/Clarimonde Family/Blair Clarimonde\|Blair Clarimonde]].
