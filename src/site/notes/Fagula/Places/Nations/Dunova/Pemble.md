Pemble
--
A small mining village in [[Fagula/Places/Nations/Dunova/Nation of Dunova\|Nation of Dunova]] that was once in a period of expansion due to a magical ore vein beneath the town. The mine eventually collapsed, killing many, destroying the economy of the town, and taking [[Fagula/Characters/Allies/Party/Edgar (Pemble)\|Edgar (Pemble)]]'s arm with it, as well as his sister [[Fagula/Characters/Allies/Emily\|Emily]].
